## üõ†Ô∏è Set up

If this is your first time using Redwood Auth, you should first familiarize yourself with how [Redwood authentication](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/authentication) works.

Create a new redwood app:

```bash
yarn create redwood-app myDapp
```

> See my [introductory blog post](https://patrickgallagher.dev/blog/2020/11/18/web3-redwood-intro/using-redwoodjs-to-create-an-ethereum-app) for more help getting started.

### Scaffolding

First let's do some scaffolding and install the necessary packages. This is where the üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® magic happens!

```bash
cd myDapp
yarn rw setup auth ethereum --force
```

Until Redwood PR [#3337](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/3337) has been released, the CLI command above won't add two files. You'll need to add these manually to your project for now:

- https://github.com/oneclickdapp/ethereum-auth/blob/master/examples/eth-auth-demo/api/src/graphql/authDetails.sdl.js
- https://github.com/oneclickdapp/ethereum-auth/blob/master/examples/eth-auth-demo/api/src/services/ethereumAuth/ethereumAuth.js

You should now have a new `ethereumAuth` service and sdl files, and a few new dependencies (including this package). If you're curious how the auth service works, check out `api/src/services/ethereumAuth/ethereumAuth.js`

Next we need to update our models. Add `address` to the **User** model, and create a new `AuthDetail` model:

```js
// api/db/schema.prisma
model User {
  id           String     @id @default(uuid())
  address      String     @unique
  authDetail   AuthDetail @relation(fields: [authDetailId], references: [id])
  authDetailId String     unique
}

model AuthDetail {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  nonce     String
  timestamp DateTime @default(now())
  User      User?
}
```

Now lets use the generator for our user model.

```bash
yarn rw generate scaffold user
```

Awesomesauce! Let's spin up our database and apply the changes:

```bash
yarn rw prisma migrate dev
```

We're almost there! Create a server secret for issuing jwt tokens:

```bash
yarn rw g secret
# or
openssl rand -base64 48
```

Use the resulting string for `ETHEREUM_JWT_SECRET` in your `.env` file.

And don't forget to update your `Redwood.toml` for including the environment variables in your hosted app.

```toml
[web]
  includeEnvironmentVariables = ['ETHEREUM_JWT_SECRET', 'DATABASE_URL', 'INFURA_ID']
```

### Webpack V5

Webpack V5 no longer injects some node modules automatically, which are required by the `@walletconnect` dependencies. To fix this issue, you must add them manually to the webpack config in your RedwoodJS app.

> Want to help out by removing this extra step? The [`@walletconnect` V5 update issue](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/issues/584) is waiting for a champion!

If you haven't run this command already, create the config file:

```bash
yarn rw setup webpack
```

Then add the following to your config in `web/config/webpack.config.js`:

```js
const webpack = require("webpack");

// See https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/issues/584
config.resolve.fallback = {
  os: require.resolve(`os-browserify/browser`),
  https: require.resolve(`https-browserify`),
  http: require.resolve(`stream-http`),
  stream: require.resolve(`stream-browserify`),
  util: require.resolve(`util/`),
  url: require.resolve(`url/`),
  assert: require.resolve(`assert/`),
  crypto: require.resolve(`crypto-browserify`)
};
config.plugins.push(
  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
    process: "process/browser",
    Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"]
  })
);
```

Now install the missing 8 packages:

```bash
cd web
yarn add stream-browserify stream-http crypto-browserify https-browserify os-browserify util url assert
```

Test the app builds properly in development and production

```bash
yarn rw dev

# It works in development? Great!

yarn rw build
```

Done! You're ready to start using your shiny new Ethereum auth just like any other RedwoodJS auth provider.

## Usage

Start your RedwoodJS app:

```bash
yarn rw dev
```

Here's a quick snippet to help get you started. Check out the `/examples` folder for more.

```js
// web/src/pages/LoginPage/LoginPage.js
import { Link, routes, navigate } from "@redwoodjs/router";
import { useAuth } from "@redwoodjs/auth";
import { useParams } from "@redwoodjs/router";

const LoginPage = () => {
  const { logIn } = useAuth();
  const { redirectTo } = useParams();

  const onLogin = async () => {
    await logIn();
    navigate(redirectTo || routes.home());
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h1>LoginPage</h1>
      <p>
        You must have an ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask, installed in your
        browser
      </p>
      <button onClick={onLogin}>Log in with Ethereum</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default LoginPage;
```

## Options

### Wallet Connect

You must pass at least one value `rpc` or `infuraId` to use Wallet Connect.

```js
ethereum = new EthereumAuthClient({
  makeRequest,
  // Note: you must set NODE_ENV manually when using Netlify
  debug: process.NODE_ENV !== "development",
  infuraId: process.env.INFURA_ID
  // For rpc see https://docs.walletconnect.org/quick-start/dapps/web3-provider#provider-options
});
```

Specify the wallet type by passing a String to `logIn()`

```js
const { logIn, logOut, getCurrentUser } = useAuth()

const onClickWalletConnect = async () => {
  await logIn({type: "walletConnect"})
```

> Note: Don't forget to update Redwood.toml if you add new environment variables

## Additional Resources

Now that you've completed setup, you might find these resources useful. More docs/examples are welcome here!

- Cookbook RBAC https://redwoodjs.com/cookbook/role-based-access-control-rbac

## Developing

In this repo link and watch files:

```bash
yarn link
yarn watch
```

Then in your app, use the local linked package

```bash
yarn link @oneclickdapp/ethereum-auth
```

### Advanced

If you're changes affect how internal stuff in RedwoodJS uses this package, then you'll need to do a bit more work. Things that may be affected include decoders in `@redwoodjs/api`, frontend tooling in `@redwoodjs/auth`, and CLI generators in `@redwoodjs/cli`. Unfortunately, `yarn link` will not work for redwood local development. Please follow the guide here https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development for more help.

```bash
# In the redwood repo
yarn build:watch

# Then in your example redwood app
yarn rwt copy:watch ../redwood
```

## TODO

- [x] Add support for `walletconnect`
- [ ] Add ethereum-auth the redwood (auth playground)[https://github.com/redwoodjs/playground-auth]
- [ ] Allow direct access to the ethers `provider` on the client.
- [ ] Better error handling when wallet signing fails
- [ ] Export typescript types here for the user object, instead of declaring them inside `@redwoodjs/auth`
- [ ] Add support for `walletlink`

## Publishing

```bash
yarn publish --dry-run
```
